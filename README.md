# Rover-prototype

Rover is a SAM module generating system, which generates SAM projects based on user requirements. Initially, we will have a set of predefined stacks(Auth, CRUD) which are commonly used. It is designed using typescript with SAM CLI support. Currently, it is a CLI-based library that supports Node and Python with a limited set of AWS services.
